Thanks for downloading the offline version of the Puppet Labs documentation
site.

This is just like the version of the docs available at
https://docs.puppetlabs.com, except most absolute links have been changed to
relative ones to make offline browsing easier. To begin reading, open any .html
file in this archive in your web browser.

Note that some conveniences provided by web servers (like translating
`<DIRECTORY>/` to `<DIRECTORY>/index.html`) aren't available, and on some
systems, links that include `/latest/` may not work quite right; you can get
around this by browsing manually to any affected files.
