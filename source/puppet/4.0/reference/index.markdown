Welcome to the Puppet 4.0 Reference Manual. Use the navigation to the left to get around.

## What Is This?

For an introduction to how Puppet manages systems, see the [Overview of Puppet's Architecture.](./architecture.html) 

## Getting Started

To install Puppet 4.0, see the Puppet installation guides for [Linux](./install_linux.html) and [Windows](./install_windows.html). For general advice on upgrading to Puppet 4.0 from Puppet 3.x, we've prepared two guides:

* [3.x to 4.0 Agent Upgrades](agent_upgrades.html)
* [3.x to 4.0 Server Upgrades](server_upgrades.html)

## Getting Around

* [The Puppet 4.0 Release Notes](./release_notes.html) contain information about Puppet 4.0's new features, and tracks changes from patch releases.
* If you're an experienced Puppet user, you'll want to take a look at the [Where Did Everything Go?](./whered_it_go.html) page
