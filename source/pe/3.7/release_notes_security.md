## Puppet Enterprise 3.8 (??/??/15)

### Security Fixes


### Bug Fixes

Puppet Enterprise 3.8 contains a number of performance and documentation improvements, in addition to the fixes that are highlighted below.

#### Browser Crashing Issue

In PE 3.7.2, the browser would crash when the `users` endpoint for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) returned a `NULL` value for `inherited_role_ids`. A `NULL` value is returned when you delete the user roles for a user group and then view the user. In PE 3.8, this has been fixed and the browser no longer crashes.

#### Page Rendering Issue in the Console

In PE 3.7, if you create a new user role in RBAC, then add a permission to the user role that has the **Node groups** permission type, and select a specific node instance that the permission applies to, you will subsequently experience the following unexpected behavior if that specific node instance is deleted:

- In the PE console, if you go to the **Permissions** tab for the new role that was added, the deleted node instance is displayed as a dash in the **Object** column.
-  This unexpected value would cause the javascript rendering the page to prematurely stop and the page rendering would be incomplete.

###  New PE 3.7.x MCO Servers Were Not Connecting With Older MCollective Agents (posted 12/17/14)

Some customers experienced problems connecting PE 3.7 MCO clients, such as Live Management, with older MCO servers (Puppet agents). Specifically, any MCO servers running on PE 3.3.2 agents and older. To fix this problem, we recommend upgrading your PE agents to 3.7.x so you can continue using activemq heartbeats.
